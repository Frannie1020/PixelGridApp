This GUI takes two number inputs from the user, defining the 
number of rows and columns. Decide for yourself what the best way for this user input is. Next to 
the user input there is a “run”-Button. When the run-button is pressed, a grid of the specified rows 
and columns is created below the input and button. In this created grid, each of these pixels is black
by default, but when the user clicks one pixel, this pixel will change to white color and after another 
click back to black. 
To simplify this task, the grid is restricted to 1-100 Pixel, i.e. rows and columns user inputs are 
restricted to the range of 1 and 10.
